# Title: Implement OAuth Service for Authentication
### Description

We need to add OAuth-based authentication to the application to allow users to log in using third-party services (e.g., Google, GitHub, etc.). This will improve user convenience and security by leveraging external identity providers.
### Tasks

    Research and choose an OAuth library (e.g., passport, openid-client).
    Set up routes for OAuth login and callback.
        /auth/:provider
        /auth/:provider/callback
    Configure OAuth providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).
        Create OAuth credentials in provider dashboards.
        Store keys securely using environment variables.
    Implement JWT token generation after successful OAuth authentication.
    Add middleware to verify user tokens.
    Test the integration with multiple OAuth providers.

### Acceptance Criteria

    Users can log in using at least one OAuth provider (e.g., Google).
    Tokens are securely generated and returned after login.
    Middleware correctly validates tokens for protected routes.
    Integration is tested for edge cases and error handling.
